# C3PO Compiler

C3PO is a small experimental compiler for a custom programming language that I’m building from scratch.  
The main goal of this project is to **learn by doing** — to understand the full process of implementing a programming language, step by step.

## Features (Work in Progress)
- Variable assignment

## Goals
- Explore the internals of compilers (lexing, parsing, AST, interpretation, and code generation)  
- Build a simple but functional language to experiment with new ideas  
- Keep the code modular and easy to extend as the language evolves

## Example
```c
var x = 42
